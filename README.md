## Learning Laravel
Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I'm all about learning through hands-on experience, and this project is my personal learning ground with Laravel. 
What's unique? I'm following tutorials on Pluralsight. After watching each tutorial, 
I put my skills to the test by recreating the project from scratch. It's a journey of absorbing, 
practicing, and refining. ðŸŒŸðŸ“š #LaravelLearningPoweredByPluralsight
