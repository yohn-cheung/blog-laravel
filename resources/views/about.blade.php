    Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I'm all about learning through hands-on experience, and this project is my personal learning ground with Laravel. 
    What's unique? I'm following tutorials on Pluralsight. After watching each tutorial, 
    I put my skills to the test by recreating the project from scratch. It's a journey of absorbing, 
    practicing, and refining. Join me as I make strides in Laravel with Pluralsight lighting the way!
